# Cover-biomass relationships for Seaweeds and surfgrass

This repository provides datasets and R code for the analysis of cover-biomass relationships in "岩礁性の海藻・海草の被度と現存量の関係式　(Coverage-biomass relationships for seaweeds and surfgrass in Japane)"  to examine relationships between biomass and cover of seaweeds and surfgrass around Japanese coasts.

## Data share

The raw data described below are housed in the folder.

* Make figures for relationships between cover and biomass : xxx.csv

## Plots

The folder "Plots" includes all results of figures obtained by running "Arame.R" and "Arame\_cover100%.R".

* You can see statistical resuls for Eisenia (Arame) : res/Arame\_statistical analysis\_results.xlsx

## R codes

This repository shares the following programming codes to make figures or run the analyses.

* Make figures for relationships between cover and biomass of each species for each region : xxxx.R
* Make figures for estimated biomass of each species at 100% cover: xxxx\_cover100%.R
