# Cover-biomass relationships for Seaweeds and surfgrass

This repository provides datasets and R code for the analysis of cover-biomass relationships in "岩礁性の海藻・海草の被度と現存量の関係式　(Coverage-biomass relationships for seaweeds and surfgrass in Japan)"  to establish relationships between biomass and cover for seaweeds and surfgrass in Japan.



## Data

The raw data described below are housed in the folder "Data".

* Data of cover and biomass for each seaweeds or surfgrass (xxx) at each site : xxx.csv
* All of the data for each seaweeds or surfgrass at each site :Kaiso\_data.xlsx



## Plots

The folder "Plots" includes all results of figures obtained by running "xxx.R" and "xxx\_cover100%.R".

* Figures for the  relationship between cover and biomass (i.e., model (mod z (z = 1, 2, or 3))) for each seaweeds or surfgrass (xxx) at site y  : xxx\_y\_mod z.svg
* Figures for the estimated biomass of all the models at 100% coverage for each seaweeds or surfgrass (xxx) with width aaaa : xxx100\_Regiontype\_aaaa.svg



## R code

The folder "R code" shares the following programming codes to mrun the analyses and make figures.

* Perform statistical analysis and make figures for relationships between cover and biomass of each species (xxx) for each region : xxx.R
* Make figures for estimated biomass of each species (xxx) at 100% cover : xxx\_cover100%.R
